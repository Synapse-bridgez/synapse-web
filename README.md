# Synapse Core

A Soroban transaction-lifecycle dashboard built with Next.js 16 and React 19.
Synapse Core lets you inspect, trace, and drive transactions through a Soroban
smart contract deployed on Stellar Testnet — from registration through
completion or failure.

> **Current state: real wallet + contract calls, mock data as fallback.**
> Connect a Freighter or xBull wallet and every action (admin functions, transaction
> lifecycle actions, callback registration, diagnostics) submits a real signed
> transaction or read-only simulation against `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID`. Without a
> connected wallet or a configured contract, the dashboard and transaction list fall
> back to `lib/mock-data.ts` so the UI is still explorable. A standalone backend relay
> service is still tracked in the open issues below.

### Mock data as fallback

`lib/mock-data.ts` exports the baseline data every tab renders when no wallet is
connected or `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` isn't configured:

| Export               | Used by                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `MOCK_TXS`           | `useLiveTransactions` baseline (stat cards, pipeline, tables)                  |
| `MOCK_CONTRACT_INFO` | `useLiveContractInfo` baseline (address, admin, relay_signer, health, version) |

Once a wallet is connected and a contract is configured, live RPC events and reads
take over — see `lib/soroban/transactionMerge.ts` and `lib/soroban/useLiveContractInfo.ts`.

## Runtime Contract Switcher & Multi-Deployment Tracking

The dashboard allows tracking and switching between multiple deployed Soroban contract IDs at runtime (for example, switching between a personal Testnet deployment and a shared staging deployment) without requiring environment changes or frontend rebuilds.

### Features
- **Contract-Switcher UI**: Integrated directly into the shell header with dropdown navigation, tracked deployments list, active badge indicators, and "+ ADD CONTRACT ID" form.
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Contract selections and custom added deployments are persisted across browser reloads via `localStorage` (matching the pattern in `lib/wallet/storage.ts`).
- **Clean Re-scoping & Zero Stale-Data Leakage**:
  - Switching contracts tears down the existing `lib/soroban/events.ts` poller and establishes a fresh one scoped to the new contract ID.
  - Event poller cursors in `localStorage` are scoped per contract ID (`soroban-event-cursor:<contractId>`), ensuring event feeds never collide.
  - `useLiveTransactions` immediately wipes cached enrichment state and resets fetch registries upon contract switch.
  - `useLiveContractInfo` immediately wipes previous live health/version state and cancels any pending in-flight read requests.
  - `AdminTab`, `TransactionsTab`, and `TxDetailModal` automatically route all simulations and contract invocations to the active contract ID.

### Demonstration: Switching Live Between Two Testnet Instances
1. **Initial Contract A (Shared Testnet)**:
   - Select or configure Contract A: `CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC`.
   - The contract info panel reflects Contract A's address and simulated `health()`/`version()`.
   - Live events from Contract A are streamed into the pipeline and transaction tables.
2. **Switching to Contract B (Personal Testnet)**:
   - Click the **CONTRACT: ...** switcher in the header.
   - Click **+ ADD CONTRACT ID** and enter Contract B: `CA3D5KRYMCMCZKPO722ECQQQ3QHOFGT2TJNITW5OECVOAQCEK7ALISVN` with label `Personal Testnet`.
   - Click **Save & Switch**.
   - Contract A's event poller is torn down and stopped immediately.
   - All displayed events and enriched transaction state from Contract A are flushed to avoid stale leakage.
   - Poller for Contract B connects with its own scoped cursor and starts polling Contract B.
   - Contract info panel switches to Contract B, resetting old fields and re-fetching `health()` and `version()` for Contract B.
   - Your selection is remembered in `localStorage` on page reload.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The app starts on the
**dashboard** tab. Connect a Freighter or xBull wallet and use the runtime **CONTRACT** switcher in the header (or configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL` in `.env.local`) to interact with live Testnet contracts.

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run test         # Run the test suite once
npm run test:unit    # Unit tests only (what the pre-push hook runs)
npm run test:watch   # Run the test suite in watch mode
npm run format       # Prettier (writes)
npm run format:check # Prettier (CI check)
```

npm run format:check # Prettier (CI check)

## Adding a new tab

1. Create `components/<name>/<Name>Tab.tsx` and export a `<NameTab />` component.
2. Add the tab key to the `TABS` array in `components/Shell.tsx`.
3. Add a matching `{tab === "<name>" && <NameTab />}` render block in `Shell.tsx`.
4. Wrap it in `<TabErrorBoundary>` like the existing tabs.

## Roadmap / open issues

Remaining backend and contract-ABI work is tracked in the upstream repo's issue
tracker:

- [Synapse-bridgez/synapse-web — open issues](https://github.com/Synapse-bridgez/synapse-web/issues)

Notable milestones on the path to a working testnet client:

- [x] Replace `alert()` stubs across `AdminTab`, `TxDetailModal`, and `TransactionsTab` with real
      `TransactionBuilder` + sign + submit calls (`lib/soroban/contract.ts`)
- [x] Wire `MOCK_TXS` / `MOCK_CONTRACT_INFO` to live `rpc.Server` reads (`useLiveTransactions`,
      `useLiveContractInfo`), falling back to mock data when no wallet/contract is configured
- [x] Integrate `@creit.tech/stellar-wallets-kit` (Freighter / xBull) for wallet connection
      (`lib/wallet/`)
- [x] Command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`) for tab navigation, key actions, and settings toggles
      (`components/command-palette/CommandPalette.tsx`)
- [ ] Backend relay service for `register_transaction`, `start_processing`, `complete_transaction`,
      `fail_transaction`, and `register_callback` webhooks
- [ ] Fetch `admin` / `relay_signer` from the deployed contract once it exposes a getter for them
      (currently sourced from `lib/mock-data.ts` / env, since the ABI has none)
